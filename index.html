						<!--<p>Let’s cut to the chase: social media is critical to reaching B2B customers.</p>-->
						<!--<p>In a 2012 study, social media was one of the preferred channels for information, second only to research reports. </p>-->
						<!--<p>Research also shows that B2B decision makers rely heavily on the advice, experience, and expertise of their peers. So the exchange of information among colleagues that happens via social channels makes it an increasingly important part of the purchase decision.</p>-->

						<!--<h3>What are the implications for Adobe Marketing Cloud?</h3>-->
						<!--<p>Our experience in working on the brand advertising for Marketing Cloud has made it clear to us how much opportunity there is to engage the B2B audience. And we believe that social can be at the center of communication to the B2B audience. </p>-->
						<!--<p>As Adobe’s business model changes from a product-based interaction with its customers to more of a relationship-based, long-term engagement, social channels are as critical to communication as the telephone once was.</p>-->

						<h2 id="gsp_approach">The GSP Approach</h2>    
                        <p>Our approach, regardless of the channel or target, is the same: to make stuff people care about.</p>
						<p>The digital space offers a rich palette to draw from. It offers freedom to try new things, learn from behaviors, tailor ideas and invite users to be part of our creative journey.</p>
						<p>In short, it is a channel we value greatly.</p>
						<p>In 2012 we introduced the Beta Group, a cross-discipline department that includes creatives, web developers, designers, user-experience experts and interactive producers - all led by our new chief digital officer. The mission is to drive our agency ideas forward using technology, interactive prototypes and in-house production.</p>
						<p>The Beta Group works with our account, strategy and creative teams to build on ideas and help us think about things a little differently.</p>
						<p>It's about creating something - a piece of content, a conversation, an insight - that grabs attention, turns on a little light in a person's head and changes behavior.</p>

                        <p>When we make things people care about, we're ultimately asking them to take an action. GSP has created numerous digital and social experiments for our clients over the years, and we've had a lot of success - and a lot of fun - engaging people and watching them react in any number of forms, from simply sharing to building their own community to making a purchase.</p>
						<p>Below are four examples that we're particularly proud of that showcase how we can execute on an idea and how well communities have responded.</p>

                                <p>For the National Audubon Society, we took an offline, often solitary pastime and turned it into a communal online frenzy that was enjoyed by seasoned ornithologists and a new generation who were experiencing bird watching for the first time ever. </p>

                                <p>Social is often about a shared experience. Chevy leveraged one of America’s largest shared experiences: the Super Bowl. For decades advertisers have flocked to the Super Bowl, but there is one simple secret most advertisers have failed to realize: the majority of Americans watching the Super Bowl don’t care about the game. Chevy hacked one of the biggest social events by creating a second-screen experience that made the Super Bowl truly social. The Chevy Game Time app acted as a Trojan horse, allowing the brand to push even more content to this enormous audience and earning more of the Super Bowl conversation than paid media could ever have bought.</p>

                        <!--<p>In early 2011 we worked with you to create the “Adobe &” campaign, initiating Adobe’s presence and credibility in the category. But we learned from marketers that we had to do more than simply declare, “Adobe is here.” They needed to see that Adobe understands them and their changing environment better than anyone else does. We demonstrated exactly that with the “Metrics. Not Myths” campaign, striking a chord with marketers by debunking the taunt that “Marketing is BS.” </p>-->
                        <!--<p>Our campaigns have shown marketers that Adobe is in their corner and can help to cement their importance within the enterprise. Today we challenge marketers to know what their marketing is doing, exposing their accountability and offering ways to help them. </p>-->
